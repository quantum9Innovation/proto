# Color

This document describes the expectations that users should have about color use within Proto's application suite and guidelines for how that color should be applied to different components

---

Proto uses "dynamic color," a standard developed in [Material You](https://m3.material.io/styles/color/dynamic-color/overview) which allows for a variable color palette.
The Material Design specification lists three types of color palettes that can be incorporated: a default palette for use in the absence of color preference information, a palette based on a user's wallpaper on a mobile device, and a palette based on in-app content.
Given that Proto does not currently have any in-app immersive content, it makes sense to develop only two of the listed palette options.

## Default Palette

This color palette is used on platforms that don't support dynamic color (e.g. web) and should express Proto's "brand colors" to create a unified cross-platform experience.
