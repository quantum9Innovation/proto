# Design Documentation

This directory is a repository for all design and prototyping of the Proto frontend.
Documentation listed here is subject to rapid changes as the development team iterates over different designs, but it can be useful for customizing the app's appearance or debugging style issues.
Proto borrows most standards and components from [**Material You**](https://m3.material.io), the latest version of Google's Material Design, in all deployments.
